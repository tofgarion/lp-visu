~lp_visu~ is a simple Python module using matplotlib to visualize the
progress of the simplex algorithm. You can use for instance
~scipy.optimize.linprog~ and its callback function to visualize the
algorithm used by ~linprog~. See ~lp_visu_example.py~ for an example.

This code surely needs some refactoring, do not hesitate to give me
suggestions or to send me pull requests!
